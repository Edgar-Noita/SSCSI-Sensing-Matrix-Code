# SSCSI-Sensing-Matrix-Code

This repository allows the user to access an create the SSCSI sensing matrix for the different cases studied in detail in "Salazar et al. Spectral zooming and resolution limits of spatial spectral compressive spectral imagers". Please cite this if used.

A detailed explanation of the files can be found next:

sensing_leq.m: Function that models the sensing process for supper-resolved problems (Eq. 18 of reference paper)

imp_leq.m: File that implements sensing_leq.m. Notice that Delta_c/(1-s)<Delta_d, and Delta_d is an integer multiple of Delta_d
